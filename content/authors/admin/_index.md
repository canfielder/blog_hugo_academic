I am currently a graduate student in the Data Science & Business Analytics program at UNC Charlotte. For the past ten years I have worked as a design engineer in the Nuclear Power industry. I am looking to expand my skill set into Data Science. Lately, I have become interested in the developing of machine learning models in a cloud environment, employing Continuous Integration and Development principles. I am also very passionate about data visualization, and enjoy tackling projects that allow me to employ new  methods for communicating information visually.
