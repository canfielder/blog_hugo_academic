        "# Project Outline\n",
        "The first deviation I made for this project was to expand on the simple python script which would be contained within the Docker container. Instead of a simple \"Hello World\" script, I decided to develop a simple Flask app which would employ a pickled scikit-learn model. This would give me the chance to work developing a model in a notebook and then exporting for use in another location. It might not surprise most of you that this process was pretty simple, but I had yet to try this, so it was good practice. \n",
        "\n",

        "2. Create Flask app, using the pickled model.\n",

        "For the work of developing a model in a notebook, I used Google Colab. For Flask app and docker container development I worked in the AWS Cloud9 space. Finally, to test that the docker image was successfully created and deployed to DockerHub, I deployed the docker image to new environment, in this case Google Cloud Platform. \n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 1 - Develop a Model\n",
        "Before I developed a model, I needed to identify a problem and an associated dataset. As this project was about created a Docker Container, and not data processing or model accuracy, I decided to pick a pretty simple, clean dataset. I went with the Wine Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. There's a good chance you've seen it before. It's not **Iris** popular, but it's popular. The dataset can be found here: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).\n",
        "\n",
        "I focused only on the Red Wine part of the data. The data contained 12 variables, 11 features with one dependent variable. The dependednt variable was **wine quality** one a 1 - 10 scale. All variables were contiuous. \n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, I ran ran the data through four different regression models: linear regression, random forest regression, gradient boost regression, and support vector machines regression. The input data was also scalled with a Standard Scalar. \n",
        "\n",
        "The full analysis can be best seen in the notebook here: [https://github.com/canfielder/DSBA-6190_Proj2/blob/master/wine_predict/wine_quality_predict.ipynb](https://github.com/canfielder/DSBA-6190_Proj2/blob/master/wine_predict/wine_quality_predict.ipynb)\n",
        "\n",
        "While none of the models performed all that well, random forest regression performed the best. So I exported **BOTH** the random forest regression model JOBLIB file **AND** the standard scalar JOBLIB file. You need both files to correctly use the model on our test data. \n",
        "\n",
        "With the model created and exported, I was ready to create the Flask app.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Step 2 - Flask App\n",
        "As the class this project is for is a Cloud Computing class, most of the work I do is in cloud environments. This work is no different. So for this step I used Amazon Web Service's Cloud9 tool. For those who haven't used it, Cloud9 is a great environment for development, allowing easy access to the terminal and an IDE for visualizing your code. Plus, the default setting is for your instance to hibernate automatically after 30 minutes of no activity. No need to worry about accidentally leaving an instance running and unknowingly running up a bill.\n",
